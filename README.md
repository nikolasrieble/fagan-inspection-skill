# Fagan Inspection Skill

Systematic code inspection methodology for finding errors through structured team review. Based on Michael Fagan's formal inspection process (1976).

## What This Is

A skill for conducting Fagan inspections - a proven method for finding 60-82% of errors before testing through systematic code review with defined roles, checklists, and metrics.

## Quick Start

**With Claude Code:**
```
"Conduct a Fagan inspection on src/auth/login.js"
```

**For teams:** See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the complete 5-phase process.

## Documentation

- **[SKILL.md](SKILL.md)** - Complete methodology and process guide
- **[HOW-TO-USE.md](HOW-TO-USE.md)** - Step-by-step usage instructions
- **[QUICK-REFERENCE.md](QUICK-REFERENCE.md)** - One-page quick reference
- **[references/](references/)** - Checklists, error classifications, roles, phases
- **[examples/](examples/)** - Sample inspection sessions

## When to Use

- Critical code reviews (security, payments, data integrity)
- Pre-deployment quality audits
- Design reviews before implementation
- Pull request reviews requiring rigor
- Training teams in systematic review

## Expected Results

When properly executed:
- 60-82% of errors found before testing
- 38% fewer errors vs. informal reviews
- 10-100× cost savings vs. fixing errors in production
